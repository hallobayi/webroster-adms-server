     * Whether oficinas.timezone holds a generic zone instead of a real one.
     *
     * "UTC", "GMT", "Etc/*" and bare offsets ("+00:00") are all valid IANA
     * identifiers, so DeviceController::normalizeTimezone() accepts them and
     * they look perfectly fine in the table. A physical office with a building
     * and a terminal in it is never actually in one of them - they end up here
     * when the field was defaulted or never filled in.
     *
     * Leaving one in place costs two things:
     *
     *  - the monitor card computes "today" over the wrong 24 hours, and
     *  - getrequest() builds "SET OPTIONS DateTime=" from it. An Indonesian
     *    office recorded as UTC makes the server order a 7 hour shift, the
     *    terminal obeys, its punches then look skewed, and the next poll
     *    orders another correction - a feedback loop that never settles.
     *
     * Treat these as "not filled in yet": warn about them and never hand a
     * terminal a clock built from one.
