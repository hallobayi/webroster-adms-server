/**
 * The ADMS wire vocabulary: how a command looks on the way to a terminal.
 *
 * Every command a terminal receives is framed the same way —
 *
 *     C:{cmdId}:{payload}
 *
 * — and the payload is one of a small, fixed set of instructions ("CHECK",
 * "DATA UPDATE USERINFO", "CONTROL DEVICE", …). Both halves used to be spelled
 * out by hand at each call site, in four different styles (string
 * interpolation, sprintf, concatenation), which is how "DATA DELETE USERINFO"
 * ended up written two slightly different ways and how the `C:{cmdId}:` prefix
 * came to be duplicated nine times.
 *
 * This class is deliberately static and dependency-free: it is the one place
 * that knows the protocol, it is trivial to unit test, and it cannot reach the
 * database by accident.
 *
 * Note on `CONTROL DEVICE`: the trailing hex word is a firmware-defined
 * device-control code, not something this server computes. 03000000 is the code
 * this fleet's terminals treat as a reboot, which is what the UI has always
 * labelled "restart".
 *
 * @see AdmsCommandService for queueing the result onto a device.

     *    valid that a terminal said was not, and the only thing that can ever
